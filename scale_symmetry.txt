Title: Scale Relativity & the Copernican Principle

Description:
What if our human scale is not privileged in the universe? This topic introduces the idea of scale symmetryâ€”a Copernican revolution for our perception of size and time. It suggests that every scale, from subatomic to cosmic, could be equally central, and that our physics may be just a cross-section of a multi-scale reality. This perspective challenges conventional thinking in physics and cosmology, proposing that time and structure may be fractal-like, with nested universes and endless evolution at every scale.
