As researchers, we spend an inordinate amount of time crafting presentations. The process often involves wrestling with tools like PowerPoint or LaTeX Beamer, meticulously designing slides to communicate complex ideas effectively. But what if we could transform this process by leveraging AI agents through vibe-coding?

## The codification of presentation design

Presentation design has undergone several waves of codification. First came the shift from physical slides to digital tools like PowerPoint. Then LaTeX Beamer emerged, turning presentation design into a structured, code-driven process. This codification made presentations more reproducible and consistent but still required significant manual effort.

In designing my PhD progress presentation, I pushed this codification one step further by vibe-coding with AI agents in GitHub Copilot.

## What is "vibe-coding"?

"Vibe-coding" is the practice of collaborating with AI agents on code, where you:

1. **Provide instructions** about what you want to achieve
2. **The AI writes the code** based on your description
3. **You test the code** and either continue or provide error feedback
4. **Iterate until completion**, with the AI handling the technical details

This approach transforms you from code writer to code director, focusing on the creative vision while the AI handles implementation details.

## Defense talk

For my presentation titled "Modeling Real-Time Cognition via Test-Time Adaptation in Artificial Neural Networks," I created a comprehensive GitHub repository that included:

- **Source Material**: My three PhD research papers providing the content foundation
- **LaTeX Infrastructure**: A Beamer presentation file with custom theme styling
- **Compilation Tools**: Scripts for building the presentation
- **Structure Documents**: Outlines detailing the flow and narrative

Instead of manually writing LaTeX code, I engaged in a vibe-coding dialogue with AI. This looked something like:

> **Me**: "Create a slide that presents the experimental methodology from Paper 3, with a focus on the network architecture and test-time adaptation process."
> 
> **AI**: *generates complete LaTeX code for the slide*
> 
> **Me**: "The figure placement looks off. Can you adjust the layout to put the diagram on the left with a 60/40 split?"
> 
> **AI**: *revises the code with the requested changes*

## The benefits of vibe-coding presentations

This approach yielded several advantages:

### 1. Rapid prototyping

I could quickly test different presentation structures and visualizations without getting bogged down in LaTeX syntax. The AI would generate complete slides based on high-level descriptions, allowing me to evaluate multiple approaches in minutes rather than hours.

### 2. Focus on content and narrative

With the AI handling code implementation, I could dedicate more mental energy to the narrative flow and scientific content—arguably the most important aspects of an academic presentation.

### 3. Learning opportunity

As a side benefit, watching the AI generate LaTeX code improved my own understanding of Beamer's capabilities and best practices.

## Challenges and limitations

This approach wasn't without challenges:

- **Technical Precision**: Sometimes the AI misunderstood specific scientific concepts or visualization requirements, necessitating additional clarification.
- **Non-visual Inputs**: The agents in VScode cannot work with the figure files, analyze them, and place them appropriately. The figure aspect of the presentation still requires human work on the implementation level.

## What else can we codify?

This experiment raises an intriguing question: what other tasks could benefit from vibe-coding with AI agents? Is there another thing that we create that can be converted to a codebase, letting copilot/curson/windsurf agents work on it? Here are some academic suggestions:

### Experimental design

Experimental protocols could be codified and refined through dialogue with AI agents, potentially highlighting overlooked variables or methodological issues.

### Grant proposals

The structured nature of grant applications makes them amenable to codification, with AI agents helping to ensure compliance with formatting requirements while maintaining narrative coherence.

### Teaching materials

Course materials, from syllabi to assignments, could be developed through vibe-coding, ensuring pedagogical consistency while reducing preparation time.

## Conclusion: Toward a new designing workflow

The codification of tasks through vibe-coding represents more than just efficiency gains—it's a fundamental shift in how we approach intellectual work. By delegating implementation details to AI agents, we can focus more on the creative and analytical aspects of research.

For presentations specifically, this approach transforms LaTeX Beamer from a technical tool into a collaborative medium where researchers can focus on communicating their ideas effectively rather than wrestling with code.

The future of academic work may increasingly involve this partnership: humans providing vision, scientific judgment, and critical thinking, while AI agents handle the structured, codifiable aspects of our work. This doesn't diminish the intellectual nature of academic labor—rather, it elevates it by allowing us to focus on what humans do best.

Whether you're preparing your next conference talk, writing a dissertation, or developing course materials, consider what aspects of your workflow could benefit from codification and AI collaboration. The results might surprise you.
