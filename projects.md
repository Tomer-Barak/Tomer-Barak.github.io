        <h2>Development Projects</h2>
        <h3>BarakBot</h3>
        <p>BarakBot is an advanced project where users interact with a Language Learning Model (LLM) via a Telegram bot. The project is designed to handle various tasks through different LLMs, each with specific roles. The main functionalities include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Session Management</strong>: Users' conversations are managed in sessions, with prompts and responses handled by the LLMs.</li>
            <li><strong>Scheduler Integration</strong>: The scheduler LLM manages notifications and reminders based on triggers defined in a JSON file.</li>
            <li><strong>Photo Handling</strong>: The photo LLM generates captions for photos and sends them to users.</li>
            <li><strong>Web UI</strong>: A web interface for prompting and testing the LLMs</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Ph.D. Projects</h2>
        <h3>First Project</h3>
        <p>We tested an ANN's ability to extract a predictably changing feature from image sequences with various changing features. The ANN performed well on intelligence tests requiring this ability, validating its use in modeling the extraction of abstract theories.</p>
        <h3>Second Project</h3>
        <p>We studied how theories change in response to observations that contradict them. Our ANN's choice of resolution depended on the inconsistency's magnitude, highlighting flexibility in forming descriptions.</p>
        <h3>Third Project</h3>
        <p>We are studying how ANNs form analogies in general, particularly between scales of description. This work relates to the Renormalization Group framework in physics, which preserves theory structure across scales.</p>
