# Projects

## Development Projects

### BarakBot
BarakBot is an advanced project where users interact with a Language Learning Model (LLM) via a Telegram bot. The project is designed to handle various tasks through different LLMs, each with specific roles. The main functionalities include:

- **Session Management**: Users' conversations are managed in sessions, with prompts and responses handled by the LLMs.
- **Scheduler Integration**: The scheduler LLM manages notifications and reminders based on triggers defined in a JSON file.
- **Photo Handling**: The photo LLM generates captions for photos and sends them to users.
- **Web UI**: A web interface for prompting and testing the LLMs

## Ph.D. Projects

### First Project
We tested an ANN's ability to extract a predictably changing feature from image sequences with various changing features. The ANN performed well on intelligence tests requiring this ability, validating its use in modeling the extraction of abstract theories.

### Second Project
We studied how theories change in response to observations that contradict them. Our ANN's choice of resolution depended on the inconsistency's magnitude, highlighting flexibility in forming descriptions.

### Third Project
We are studying how ANNs form analogies in general, particularly between scales of description. This work relates to the Renormalization Group framework in physics, which preserves theory structure across scales.
