        <h2>My Research (Updated: November 24)</h2>
        <p>I am interested in scales of description in science and physics. For example, we can view a person as a collection of atoms or as part of a community. How do these different scales relate? Advances in machine learning provide tools to study these questions. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) transform high-dimensional inputs, such as images, into lower-dimensional categories, making them useful models for relating different scales of description.</p>
        <h3>First Project</h3>
        <p>We tested an ANN's ability to extract a predictably changing feature from image sequences with various changing features. The ANN performed well on intelligence tests requiring this ability, validating its use in modeling the extraction of abstract theories.</p>
        <h3>Second Project</h3>
        <p>We studied how theories change in response to observations that contradict them. Our ANN's choice of resolution depended on the inconsistency's magnitude, highlighting flexibility in forming descriptions.</p>
        <h3>Third Project</h3>
        <p>We are studying how ANNs form analogies in general, particularly between scales of description. This work relates to the Renormalization Group framework in physics, which preserves theory structure across scales.</p>
        <p>While these projects were framed in cognitive science, they contribute to understanding scales of description. I am developing a mathematical framework to further study this and will publish it soon.</p>
