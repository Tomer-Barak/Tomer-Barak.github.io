## My Research (Updated: November 24)
I am interested in scales of description in science and physics. For example, we can view a person as a collection of atoms or as part of a community. How do these different scales relate? Advances in machine learning provide tools to study these questions. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) transform high-dimensional inputs, such as images, into lower-dimensional categories, making them useful models for relating different scales of description.

### First Project
We tested an ANN's ability to extract a predictably changing feature from image sequences with various changing features. The ANN performed well on intelligence tests requiring this ability, validating its use in modeling the extraction of abstract theories.

### Second Project
We studied how theories change in response to observations that contradict them. Our ANN's choice of resolution depended on the inconsistency's magnitude, highlighting flexibility in forming descriptions.

### Third Project
We are studying how ANNs form analogies in general, particularly between scales of description. This work relates to the Renormalization Group framework in physics, which preserves theory structure across scales.

While these projects were framed in cognitive science, they contribute to understanding scales of description. I am developing a mathematical framework to further study this and will publish it soon.
